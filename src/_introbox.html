  <p>All credible forecasts indicate that climate change will cause sea levels to rise at an ever-more rapid pace in coming decades, including the waters of San Francisco Bay.

  <p>In the coming months, Chronicle Urban Design Critic John King will explore this challenge, including the perils facing the city’s crumbling Embarcadero, the potential rebirth of the South Bay’s salt marshes and the creation of a small city on man-made Treasure Island.

  <p>The region needs to prepare for these shifting tides. We can protect ourselves and adapt in ways that are enticing as well as scientifically sound. But to do this, the Bay Area must begin planning for that future now and upend a half-century of priorities that inhibit adventurous decision-making and design.
