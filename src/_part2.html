  <p>San Francisco’s Embarcadero and the structures along its water edge show why the city’s northeast waterfront has become so alluring — and why its future is at risk.</p>

  <p>The piers combine robust history with matchless views. There’s high culture and raffish charm, empty benches and a raucous ballpark. The wide sidewalk attracts pedestrians, joggers, cyclists and even pedicabs.</p>

  <p>But the atmospheric structures along the Embarcadero and the piers behind them would be inundated regularly at high tide by 2100 if scientific projections of rising sea levels are correct. In the meantime, the cost of bringing the aged structures up to current building codes is so high that the act of physical preservation can violate the spirit of the past, turning funky relics into posh enclaves.</p>

  <p>The biggest problem is mostly out of sight — the more-than-century-old seawall that runs for 3 miles beneath the Embarcadero and separates the bay from inland city blocks that once were shallow mud. A major earthquake could make the aging barrier of rocks and concrete lurch out into the bay while the soils behind it turn to soggy mush. But the estimated cost of needed seismic repairs already is at least $2 billion. Adapting it to prepare for 5 feet or more of sea-level rise could double the price tag.</p>

  <p>City leaders need to get seriousabout figuring out how to make the investments in the Embarcadero’s future that will be unavoidable in just a few decades. They must also decide which aspects of today’s northeast waterfront are worth preserving no matter what, and what is expendable as environmental conditions shift.</p>

  <p>The sooner this occurs, the better off we will be. The dilemmas along the Embarcadero, in a very real way, encapsulate those facing the city and the region <b>—</b> finding ways to protect our most valued resources while accepting that profound and unstoppable changes lie ahead.</p>

  <p>There’s nothing glamorous about the thick barricade that turned San Francisco’s northeast shoreline from a shifting marsh into a stable waterfront.</p>

  <p>The 3-mile stretch from Fisherman’s Wharf to AT&amp;T Park was constructed between 1878 and 1916 in 21 sections. The exact methods used to build it differed along the way, but the basics remained constant: Dig a wide trench in the bay mud. Fill it with rocks to form a blunt pyramid. Finish off the pyramid with a concrete wall that rises roughly 5 feet above the average high tide. Stand on a pier and look toward the city, and the wall can be seen below the Embarcadero’s promenade.</p>

  <p>On the inland side of the seawall, the waters left stranded were filled with sand and soil to create what is now pricey downtown real estate. Portions of Embarcadero Center rise from that fill. So do some of the glassy residential towers along Folsom Street. Above the seawall, wharves were built to hold the stately bulkhead buildings at the start of finger piers extending as much as 800 feet into the bay. Large sheds atop the piers serviced the ships doing business at what then was the West Coast’s largest port.</p>

<div class="text">
  <p>Many of those piers now are gone. The blue-collar port gave way to a modern economy where tourism is one of the city’s top industries. The seawall remains, weathered but intact,the only thing that keeps the bay from swamping the northeast corner of the city.</p>

  <p>“Every section is different, with 50 combinations of rocks and concrete along the way,” said Steven Reel, the Port of San Francisco’s project manager for adapting the 19th century seawall to 21st century challenges. “Poor soils are under it and poor soils are behind it.” Instead of rigid clay below, he explained, think a “squishy” mix of clay, soil and sand.</p>

  <p>That’s a long-term formula for disaster, according to a recent study prepared for the port that warns of “greater than expected risk to the seawall” if there’s a major earthquake on the San Andreas or Hayward faults.</p>

  <p>“Complete failure ... is unlikely,” says the report by engineering consultants GHD/GTC, but prolonged shaking could cause stretches of the seawall to slump several feet into the bay. Portions of the Embarcadero and the historic bulkhead buildings could be torn apart. The murky fill behind it would spread into the void and weaken the streets and buildings above.</p>

  <p>The study offers a clinical presentation of several engineering remedies, such as drilling through the seawall rocks and then pumping cement into the surrounding soil to strengthen it. Every method would mean years of disruption along the Embarcadero. Even a limited upgrade focused on the weakest sections would involve a “conceptual” budget of $500 million — funding sources as yet undetermined.</p>

  <p>“We need to get real specific about what to prioritize, and where we begin the regulatory approval process,” said Elaine Forbes, the port’s interim director. “The most urgent life safety measures are the ones we’ll want to implement as quickly as possible.”</p>

<div class="text">
  <p>Add rising sea levels, and the picture clouds even more.</p>

  <p>The existing seawall isn’t nearly tall enough to cope with long-term projections related to climate change. The most recent forecasts by the National Research Council, for instance, suggest that by the year 2100, the average tides here could rise by3 to more than 5 feet<b>.</b></p>

  <p>That extra layer of pressure is why the port’s engineering study estimates that the cost of strengthening the seawall at its current height is $2 billion to $3 billion — but “with consideration of sea level rise ... costs could reach $5 billion to fully incorporate adaptation measures needed for the next 100 years.”</p>

  <p>In a proactive move, City Hall and the port will spend $10 million during the next two years to begin detailed engineering and environmental studies. Any construction isat least five years away.</p>

  <p>Before those studies are completed, the city needs to confront the Embarcadero’s dilemma. The seawall can be adjusted ever upward. But what becomes of the piers and buildings left on the water side as the bay rises?</p>

  <p>Directly south of the Ferry Building, work will start this fall on two new ferry berths and a plaza that can accommodate water-borne commuters and the popular weekend farmers’ market. It’s also designed to accommodate the next 80 years of sea-level-rise projections: The elevation will be 38 incheshigher than the paving now there, and the curb along the water’s edge will extend up another 12 inches.</p>

  <p>The handsome but wearyAgriculture Building from 1915 on the south edge of the plaza-to-be will remain in place, at risk of flooding and in need of major renovation.</p>

  <p>This one small stretch of waterfront shows the bind faced by the port. Where no buildings exist, improvements can be made that prepare for the future, while making today’s waterfront more attractive and functional. But it’s not as easy to adapt stocky landmarks on old piers beyond the constructed shoreline — especially considering the costs that would be involved.</p>

  <p>In short, sea-level rise adds another complication to the long political debate over the downtown waterfront and what it should be.</p>

<div class="text">
  <p>It’s easy to forget how much has changed since 1997, when San Francisco’s current waterfront land use plan was approved after a development moratorium and four years of meetings. The goal was to bring people to the water but also protect what remained of the maritime port, from ship repair to fish processing.</p>

  <p>Parts of the plan have succeeded beyond expectations, as the Embarcadero shows.</p>

  <p>The Ferry Building’s retail bazaar opened in 2003, becoming an instant magnet. Ramshackle Pier 15 was reborn a decade later as the Exploratorium science museum. Several piers between them have been rebuilt with meticulous affection, all with public walkways along the water. There’s a new cruise terminal at Pier 27, and a grassy wharf south of the Bay Bridge near the Giants ballpark — another major improvement that’s now cherished<b>,</b> a local treasure.</p>

<div class="text">
  <p>But those projects are costly — which is why a flight of single-malt whiskeys costs $30 at Hard Water, triple the cost of a hamburger and a Rolling Rock at Red’s Java House. The latter is a simple wooden shed erected in the 1930s at the edge of Pier 30, a spot where longshoremen could grab a quick meal. The former is one of the marquee restaurants at Piers 1.5-5, a $65 million restoration completed in 2006 that includes offices for such tenants as Bloomberg News.</p>

  <p>With each such investment, the air along the Embarcadero grows more rarefied. To catch a hint of when this was a blue-collar zone, you need to peek into an unrestored survivor like Pier 28, where the long warehouse behind its Mission Revival entrance is used for pedicab parking and storage space for construction firms.</p>

<div class="text">
  <p>“Some tenants just like the sheds,” shrugged Jay Edwards, a port property manager. “They like being here. They like the funky environment.”</p>

  <p>But no matter what the condition of the piers might be, sea-level rise is an equal-opportunity foe. Water already spills across the walkways behind Piers 1.5-5 during the extreme conditions known as king tides. Pier 28 would be buffeted by high tides twice daily by 2102 at the high end of current projections. The Agriculture Building would face daily tidal onslaughts by 2068 in the same scenario.</p>

  <p>Nobody questions the importance of the piers, which have national protection as the Embarcadero Historic District. But the port is wary of giving the green light to restoration efforts that might prove short-lived, while preservationists are fearful of seeing landmarks consigned to oblivion.</p>

  <p>“One of our main concerns is that the fate of historic piers not be closed off by decisions made now,” said Mike Buhler, president of San Francisco Heritage and a member of the 32-member working group advising the port on an update to the waterfront plan. “They’re an incredibly rare and valued resource.”</p>

  <p>The port would have more flexibility if piers could contain such lucrative uses as housing or hotels. But the option of housing was ruled out in the 1960s by state regulators as not being a “water-related use,” even though other coastal states allow it on piers as long as public access remains. San Francisco voters banned hotels when they approved the 1990 initiative that spawned the waterfront land-use plan.</p>

  <p>All these constraints, though understandable at the time, make it more difficult to plan how best to face the pressures ahead.</p>

  <p>“The piers express values about how the city came to be, and how it relates to its surroundings,” said Diane Oshima, the port’s deputy director of planning. “But sea-level rise is a real issue, and it’s ahead of the solution options that now are out there.”</p>

  <p>The best scenario for the Embarcadero, and the port-owned waterfront as a whole, is to set politics aside — no easy task in San Francisco — and place sea-level rise at the center of future planning efforts along the shoreline.</p>

<div class="text">
  <p>The update to the land-use plan should include a financial strategy for fixing the seawall. It also should lay out a timetable for analyzing each pier in terms of its adaptability to rising tides and its value at bringing us close to the water. This doesn’t necessarily mean that somepiers will be written off. Instead, it will provide a context for the public and elected officials to make decisions about where scarce resources should be deployed.</p>

  <p>The update needs to explore whether the city should make the case for trade-offs in terms of the port owned-piers — allowing additional types of development if there’s a clear measurable return in terms of strengthening the seawall and giving structures like the Agriculture Building a new lease on life.</p>

  <p>These are combustible topics. But they’re best dealt with all at once, laying out possible benefits and perils side by side. If the overall package is compelling, it can go to voters as a detailed package with a laudable aim: the ongoing renewal of one of the Bay Area’s most treasured urban destinations.</p>

  <p>Forbes, the port’s interim director, understands that sea-level rise is an issue that won’t be going away.</p>
</div>

<%= t.include("_introbox.html") %>

<div class="text">

  <p>“I’d love to have us thinking about how to become perennially adaptable,” Forbes said. “Get out to mid-century and slightly beyond and continue to enjoy our assets.”</p>

  <p>Wherever discussion of the Embarcadero’s future leads, it can’t remain theoretical much longer.</p>

  <p>“We don’t know what a permanent solution is. We don’t have a proclamation to issue,” Forbes said. “If the piers are at risk, so is the Embarcadero. At some point the city will need to make decisions on how to protect itself.”</p>
