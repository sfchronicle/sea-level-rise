<p>Much research has been done to predict the effects of sea level rise around the bay area. We have collected some of the best resources here.

<li>This is one resource.
<li>This is another resource.
<li>This is a third resource.

<p>For the past half-century, our region has defined the challenge of San Francisco Bay in simple terms: Make sure it doesn’t shrink. Stop new buildings, build parks and trails, restore a patch of wetland here and there along the edge. Beyond that, leave things pretty much as they are.

<p>Now things are getting more complicated. And the next few years will determine whether or not we’re up to the task of rethinking our shorelines in the era of sea level rise.

<p>An abundance of scientific studies say the bay’s average tide could climb as much as 66 inches by 2100 will need to make sure we have fresh accurate number, with most of the change coming in the decades after 2050 — an inexorable shift that endangers low-lying neighborhoods and public infrastructure as well as the fish, birds and wildlife that need tidal flats to survive. Add the dangers posed by heavy storms at high tide, and the projections translate to maps that show much of our bayside land as vulnerable to periodic inundation. Where the San Mateo Bridge touches down, for instance. Large swaths of the island community of Alameda and all of San Francisco International Airport. The Embarcadero promenade and the green turf of AT&T Park.
