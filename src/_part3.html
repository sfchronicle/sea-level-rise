<p>For the past half-century, our region has defined the challenge of San Francisco Bay in simple terms: Make sure it doesn’t shrink. Stop new buildings, build parks and trails, restore a patch of wetland here and there along the edge. Beyond that, leave things pretty much as they are.

<p>Now things are getting more complicated. And the next few years will determine whether or not we’re up to the task of rethinking our shorelines in the era of sea level rise.

<p>An abundance of scientific studies say the bay’s average tide could climb as much as 66 inches by 2100 will need to make sure we have fresh accurate number, with most of the change coming in the decades after 2050 — an inexorable shift that endangers low-lying neighborhoods and public infrastructure as well as the fish, birds and wildlife that need tidal flats to survive. Add the dangers posed by heavy storms at high tide, and the projections translate to maps that show much of our bayside land as vulnerable to periodic inundation. Where the San Mateo Bridge touches down, for instance. Large swaths of the island community of Alameda and all of San Francisco International Airport. The Embarcadero promenade and the green turf of AT&T Park.

<p>The good news is, the region has a narrow but real window of time to prepare for what might lie ahead. In some areas the solution will involve marshes that double as environmentally friendly buffer zones. In others, where people already live and work close to the shore, smart development can help protect what’s behind it while also addressing other regional concerns, such as the lack of housing.

<p>Not only that, in the year ahead there are genuine opportunities to reset the dial.

<p>Within San Francisco, the port is tackling the first update to its waterfront plan in nearly 20 years. The decisions to be made will affect 7.5 miles of shoreline, from ever-popular Fisherman’s Wharf to decrepit piers far off the tourist map. The challenge is to push beyond the hard-line positions that have framed past waterfront debates and create new connections to the water that we’ll be proud to hand off to our children.

<p>At a regional level, residents of the nine counties surrounding the bay will vote in June on a $500 million parcel tax over 20 years that, if approved, could provide the resources to help restore at least 30,000 acres of marshes — an unprecedented step that has the potential to improve the health of the bay and provide a buffer against the extremes of sea level rise, particularly in the north and south bays.

<p>One advantage is that we aren’t starting from scratch. The regional quest to protect and replenish the bay has produced success stories both large and small. From the rebirth of diked farmland in the North Bay as scenic marshes teeming with life to San Francisco, where AT&T Park, the Ferry Building and the transformation of an unsafe warehouse at Pier 15 into the Exploratorium science museum has turned the once-dilapidated Embarcadero into one of the city’s most popular destinations.

<p>Those triumphs show the potential that exists — and the time and expense that make such turnarounds too few and far between. San Francisco and the region will need to get serious about the slow-moving threat that lies ahead. Otherwise, the larger forces of nature might swamp our best intentions once and for all.

<p>San Francisco’s shoreline has never been static.

<p>Shallow bays were filled with ship hulls and nearby hillsides to create building sites after the discovery of gold in 1848√, as a ramshackle town became the West Coast’s largest city. Wooden piers lined the Embarcadero, were pulled down and rebuilt at larger scale. A steel mill sprouted at the foot of Potrero Hill, and the U.S. Navy pushed into the bay at Hunters Point to create a base that during World War II employed as many as 18,000 people.
