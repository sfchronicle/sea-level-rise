0,highway37,Highway 37,"The California highway that might be the most vulnerable to sea level rise in coming decades is this low-slung artery that skims through North Bay marshes west of Vallejo. One long-term option proposed by UC-Davis scientists is to turn portions of Highway 37 into a causeway on pilings, raising it up and letting water flow back and forth below.",inset1.png,inset_hwy37.png
1,westcounty,Richmond's wastewater treatment plant,"Like many of our wastewater facilities, this one uses gravity flow to empty into the bay. The city now anticipates that it will need to build an effluent pump station at some point to prevent high tides or storms from defying gravity and causing wastewater discharge to back up into the plant.",inset2.png,inset_westcounty.png
2,bikepath,Mill Valley-Sausalito bike path,"Already, a commuter parking lot and the ramps that connect Manzanita Road to Highway 101 can be submerged by extreme annual high tides. With even one foot of additional sea level rise, such flooding would be daily -- and the popular bike scenic path along nearby Bohlin Marsh could be rendered all but useless without a solid barrier alongside it.",inset3.png,inset_bikepath.png
3,missioncreek,"Mission Creek, San Francisco","Surrounded by new buildings on aged bayfill, this channelized creek is adjacent to holding tanks for sewage and rainwater that can be overwhelmed in large storms. Combine heavy rains with extreme high tides, water pushing in from the bay while water (and worse) tries to spill out from the city, and nearby residents could be in for a surprise as streets begin to flood.",inset4.png,inset_missioncreek.png
4,arrowhead,Arrowhead Marsh,"Oakland International Airport faces flooding from the north side of Bay Farm Island unless berms are improved. There's a different sort of threat at nearby Arrowhead Marsh: the 50-acre restored wetland is popular with Ridgway Rails, an endangered species. Sea level rise could undo restoration efforts and turn the marsh into a mudflat, forcing rails to find other habitat -- if they can.",inset5.png,inset_arrowhead.png
5,eastpaloalto," East Palo Alto, the Gardens neighborhood","More than 1,000 houses in this modest 1950s  neighborhood sit just 7 feet above sea level, behind levees that can be swamped by a 15-year storm. Plans now call for a $41 million effort to improve the flow of San Francisquito Creek alongside it to the bay -- a project that will include new flood walls much of the way designed to withstand a 100-year storm and two feet of sea level rise.",inset6.png,inset_eastpaloalto.png
