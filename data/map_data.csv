0,hwy37,Highway 37,"The California highway that might be the most vulnerable to sea level rise in coming decades is this low-slung artery that skims through North Bay marshes west of Vallejo. One long-term option proposed by UC Davis scientists is to turn portions of Highway 37 into a causeway on pilings, letting water flow back and forth below.",waterfront0529_highway37_GR.png,inset_hwy37.png,waterfront0529_highway37_GR1.png
1,wastetreatment,Richmond's wastewater treatment plant,"Like many of our wastewater facilities, this one uses gravity flow to empty into the bay. The city now anticipates it will need to build an effluent pump station at some point to prevent high tides or storms from causing wastewater discharge to back up into the plant.",waterfront0529_westcountywastewater_GR.png,inset_westcounty.png,waterfront0529_westcountywastewater_GR1.png
2,millvalley,Mill Valley-Sausalito bike path," Already, a commuter parking lot and the ramps that connect Shoreline Highway to Highway 101 can be submerged during extreme annual high tides. With even 1 foot of additional sea level rise, such flooding would occur daily, and the popular scenic bike path along nearby Bothin Marsh could be rendered useless for hours every day.",waterfront0529_millvalleybikepath_GR.png,inset_bikepath.png,waterfront0529_millvalleybikepath_GR1.png
3,missioncreek,Mission Creek,"Surrounded by new buildings on aged bayfill, this channeled creek is adjacent to holding tanks for sewage and rainwater that can be overwhelmed in large storms. Combine heavy rains with extreme high tides, water pushing in from the bay while water (and worse) tries to spill out from the city, and nearby residents could be in for a surprise as streets begin to flood.",waterfront0529_missionchannel_GR.png,inset_missioncreek.png,waterfront0529_missionchannel_GR1.png
4,arrowhead,Arrowhead Marsh,"Oakland International Airport faces flooding from the north side of Bay Farm Island unless berms are improved. There's a different sort of threat at nearby Arrowhead Marsh: The 50-acre restored wetland is popular with Ridgway's rails, an endangered species. Sea level rise could undo restoration efforts and turn the marsh into a mudflat, forcing the birds to find other habitat -- if they can.",waterfront0529_arrowheadmarsh_GR.png,inset_arrowhead.png,waterfront0529_arrowheadmarsh_GR1.png
5,eastpaloalto,East Palo Alto's Gardens district,"More than 1,000 houses in this modest 1950s neighborhood sit just 7 feet above sea level, behind levees that can be swamped during a 15-year storm. Plans now call for a $41 million effort to improve the flow of San Francisquito Creek, which runs alongside it to the bay. The  project will include improved levees and new flood walls to withstand a 100-year storm and 2 feet of sea level rise.",waterfront0529_eastpaloalto_GR.png,inset_eastpaloalto.png,waterfront0529_eastpaloalto_GR1.png
