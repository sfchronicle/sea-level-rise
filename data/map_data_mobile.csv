0,Highway 37 where it crosses the Petaluma River,"Even today, water can splash across the surface if the average high tide is exceeded by 24 inches, what is classified as a five-year extreme tide event.One long-term option proposed by planners is to turn the roadway into a causeway, raising it up and letting water flow back and forth below.",inset1.png
1, West County Wastewater District water treatment plant,"A portion of this facility, which discharges wastewater from several older communities into the bay, sits within the current 100-year floodplain between San Pablo and Wildcat creeks. There are plans to raise the surrounding berms to lessen near-term threats, but additional protections will be needed.",inset2.png
2,Mill Valley-Sausalito bike path,"This route past Bohlin Marsh and under Highway 101 is popular with cyclists and strollers and already submerged briefly during extreme high tides. With even one foot of additional sea level rise, the path and the adjacent roadway could be rendered useless for hours each day during much of the year.",inset3.png
3,"Mission Creek, San Francisco","Surrounded by new buildings on aged landfill, this creek includes a pump state at the west end that discharges stormwater toward the bay. Combine a storm with extreme high tides, water pushing in and water trying to spill out, and nearby residents could be in for a surprise as water spills into streets.",inset4.png
4,Arrowhead Marsh,"This 50-acre restored marsh is popular for feeding and nesting with Ridgway Rails, an endangered species. The sea level rise projected for the bay would eventually reverse the recent improvements and turn it into a mudflat, forcing the rails to find other nearby habitat _ if they can.",inset5.png
5," East Palo Alto, the Garden neighborhood","Nearly one-quarter of this city sits within the 100-year flood plain and these blocks are especially vulnerable, set behind an older levee alongside San Francisquito Creek. If the levee breaks or a big storm hits, many of the low-income residents who live here will have few resources to draw on.",inset6.png
