Pier 43,"The Embarcadero promenade was extended by 880 feet, but the most forward-looking aspect here is easy to miss: The walkway tilts up toward the bay and there's a solid base to the railing, two subtle touches that should deflect projected sea level rise through at least 2070.",pier43
Pier 31,"Vacant since 2009, the shed behind the classical bulkhead from 1918 will get a $6.3 million upgrade by the Port of San Francisco, including a new roof, so it can be rented out to light-industrial tenants. The National Park Service will operate a visitors center in the bulkhead building.",pier31
Pier 15,"The arched neoclassical bulkhead structure and the shed behind it date to 1930. In 2013, the pier was reborn as the Exploratorium science museum at a construction cost of $205 million, but without structural protection to deal with rising tides.",pier15
Pier 1 Â½ to Pier 5,"Restored in 2006 at a cost of $65 million by a private developer, the complex now includes pricey office space and upscale restaurants. Visit during king tides, though, and you'll see water splashing onto the bayside walkway's stylish benches.",pier1
Ferry Terminal,Construction should soon begin on two new ferry gates south of the ones already in place behind the Ferry Building. The $85 million project will also include a new plaza for queuing up &#8212; a plaza set 3 feet above the current Embarcadero pavement.,ferryterminal
Pier 24 Annex,"This photography gallery is free to the public and limited to 30 visitors at a time. The $12.5 million restoration of the 1928 structure was done by the private Pilara Foundation of San Francisco, evidence of how the region's private wealth leaves marks on the landscape.",pier24
Pier 30 to Pier 32,"Since the structures on it burned down in 1984, this combined pier has been touted as the ideal spot for a hotel, a cruise terminal and a basketball arena. Now, part of it serves as a parking lot, and a recent port study says anything more ambitious is ""financially infeasible without significant public subsidy.""",pier30
Pier 38,"The bulkhead building, which dates to 1936, is in such poor condition that it's considered unsafe. The port has selected a developer to do upgrades, but the difficulties of improving it to withstand sea level rise may doom the pier.",pier38
